All communication between team members will be coordinated through Discord.

## 2. Project topic (e.g., parallel sorting algorithms)

### 2a. Brief project description (what algorithms will you be comparing and on what architectures)

For this project we will be comparing both merge sort and quick sort algorithms. Each sorting algorithm will be implemented using both CUDA and MPI across different number of threads in order to compare their parallel performances against their respective sequential versions. 

### MPI Merge Sort


    procedure MERGESORT(A, left, right)
    begin
        if left < right then
        begin
            middle = (left + right) / 2

            MERGESORT(A, left, middle)
            MERGESORT(A, middle + 1, right)
            MERGE(A, left, middle, right)
        end if
    end MERGESORT

Steps to be done in main:
- read in array
- initialize MPI
- split array into chunks for each thread
- send array chunk to each corresponding thread
- do merge sort on each thread
- gather all sorted chunks from each thread
- have one thread perform one last merge sort

### CUDA Merge Sort

    procedure MERGESORT(A)
    begin
        allocate memory
        Memcpy host to device
        MERGESORT_STEP<<<blocks, threads>>>(A, j, k)
        Memcpy device to host
        free allocated memory
    end MERGESORT

### MPI Quick Sort

    procedure QUICKSORT(A, start, end)
    begin
        if start < end then
        begin
            pivot = A[start]
            index = start
            for i = start+1 to end do
                if A[i] < pivot then
                begin
                    index = index + 1
                    swap(A[index], A[i])
                end if
            swap(A[start], A[index])
            QUICKSORT(A, start, index)
            QUICKSORT(A, index + 1, end)
        end if
    end QUICKSORT

Steps to be done in main:
- read in array
- initialize MPI
- split array into chunks for each thread
- send array chunk to each corresponding thread
- do quicksort on each thread
- pair up the resulting sorted chunks and continute to run quicksort until the entire array is sorted and recombined

### CUDA Quick Sort

    procedure QUICKSORT(A)
    begin
        allocate memory
        Memcpy host to device
        QUICKSORT_STEP<<<blocks, threads>>>(A, j, k)
        Memcpy device to host
        free allocated memory
    end QUICKSORT

### 2b. Pseudocode for each parallel algorithm
- For MPI programs, include MPI calls you will use to coordinate between processes
- For CUDA programs, indicate which computation will be performed in a CUDA kernel,
  and where you will transfer data to/from GPU

### 2c. Evaluation plan - what and how will you measure and compare
- Input sizes, Input types
- Strong scaling (same problem size, increase number of processors/nodes)
- Weak scaling (increase problem size, increase number of processors)
- Number of threads in a block on the GPU 


## 3. Project implementation
Implement your proposed algorithms, and test them starting on a small scale.
Instrument your code, and turn in at least one Caliper file per algorithm;
if you have implemented an MPI and a CUDA version of your algorithm,
turn in a Caliper file for each.

### 3a. Caliper instrumentation
Please use the caliper build `/scratch/group/csce435-f23/Caliper/caliper/share/cmake/caliper` 
(same as lab1 build.sh) to collect caliper files for each experiment you run.

Your Caliper regions should resemble the following calltree
(use `Thicket.tree()` to see the calltree collected on your runs):
```
main
|_ data_init
|_ comm
|    |_ MPI_Barrier
|    |_ comm_small  // When you broadcast just a few elements, such as splitters in Sample sort
|    |   |_ MPI_Bcast
|    |   |_ MPI_Send
|    |   |_ cudaMemcpy
|    |_ comm_large  // When you send all of the data the process has
|        |_ MPI_Send
|        |_ MPI_Bcast
|        |_ cudaMemcpy
|_ comp
|    |_ comp_small  // When you perform the computation on a small number of elements, such as sorting the splitters in Sample sort
|    |_ comp_large  // When you perform the computation on all of the data the process has, such as sorting all local elements
|_ correctness_check
```

Required code regions:
- `main` - top-level main function.
    - `data_init` - the function where input data is generated or read in from file.
    - `correctness_check` - function for checking the correctness of the algorithm output (e.g., checking if the resulting data is sorted).
    - `comm` - All communication-related functions in your algorithm should be nested under the `comm` region.
     - Inside the `comm` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are communicating (i.e., `comm_small` if you are sending or broadcasting a few values, `comm_large` if you are sending all of your local values).
     - Notice that auxillary functions like MPI_init are not under here.
    - `comp` - All computation functions within your algorithm should be nested under the `comp` region.
     - Inside the `comp` region, you should create regions to indicate how much data you are computing on (i.e., `comp_small` if you are sorting a few values like the splitters, `comp_large` if you are sorting values in the array).
     - Notice that auxillary functions like data_init are not under here.

All functions will be called from `main` and most will be grouped under either `comm` or `comp` regions, representing communication and computation, respectively. You should be timing as many significant functions in your code as possible. **Do not** time print statements or other insignificant operations that may skew the performance measurements.

**Nesting Code Regions** - all computation code regions should be nested in the "comp" parent code region as following:
```
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_large");
mergesort();
CALI_MARK_END("comp_large");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");
```

**Looped GPU kernels** - to time GPU kernels in a loop:
```
### Bitonic sort example.
int count = 1;
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp");
CALI_MARK_BEGIN("comp_large");
int j, k;
/* Major step */
for (k = 2; k <= NUM_VALS; k <<= 1) {
    /* Minor step */
    for (j=k>>1; j>0; j=j>>1) {
        bitonic_sort_step<<<blocks, threads>>>(dev_values, j, k);
        count++;
    }
}
CALI_MARK_END("comp_large");
CALI_MARK_END("comp");
```

**Calltree Examples**:

```
# Bitonic sort tree - CUDA looped kernel
1.000 main
├─ 1.000 comm
│  └─ 1.000 comm_large
│     └─ 1.000 cudaMemcpy

└─ 1.000 data_init
```

```

│  └─ 1.000 comp_large
└─ 1.000 data_init
```

#### 3b. Collect Metadata

Have the following `adiak` code in your programs to collect metadata:
```
adiak::init(NULL);
adiak::launchdate();    // launch date of the job
adiak::libraries();     // Libraries used
adiak::cmdline();       // Command line used to launch the job
adiak::clustername();   // Name of the cluster
adiak::value("Algorithm", algorithm); // The name of the algorithm you are using (e.g., "MergeSort", "BitonicSort")
adiak::value("ProgrammingModel", programmingModel); // e.g., "MPI", "CUDA", "MPIwithCUDA"
adiak::value("Datatype", datatype); // The datatype of input elements (e.g., double, int, float)
adiak::value("SizeOfDatatype", sizeOfDatatype); // sizeof(datatype) of input elements in bytes (e.g., 1, 2, 4)
adiak::value("InputSize", inputSize); // The number of elements in input dataset (1000)
adiak::value("InputType", inputType); // For sorting, this would be "Sorted", "ReverseSorted", "Random", "1%perturbed"
adiak::value("num_procs", num_procs); // The number of processors (MPI ranks)
adiak::value("num_threads", num_threads); // The number of CUDA or OpenMP threads
adiak::value("num_blocks", num_blocks); // The number of CUDA blocks 
adiak::value("group_num", group_number); // The number of your group (integer, e.g., 1, 10)
adiak::value("implementation_source", implementation_source) // Where you got the source code of your algorithm; choices: ("Online", "AI", "Handwritten").
```

They will show up in the `Thicket.metadata` if the caliper file is read into Thicket.

**See the `Builds/` directory to find the correct Caliper configurations to get the above metrics for CUDA, MPI, or OpenMP programs.** They will show up in the `Thicket.dataframe` when the Caliper file is read into Thicket.
